# NBA per season statistics from 2000-2024 for every Player and Team

### Our goal is to quantify the dependent, ambiguous variable of "value" using the independent variable of the player's individual statistics.

Jonathan_EDA: Create a matrix using the sum of all positive counting stats subtracted by the negative stats and the same of all related efficiency stats. I can than analyze the best statistical sesons against how effciently they collected those stats

Kevin_EDA: Determining MVP by using the Player Effciency Rating stat and weighting it based on how much older or younger the player is from the average MVP age.

Khadazhaia_EDA: Analyzes MVP winners and top 4 candidates to determine trends in player performance, team impact, and award selection. By examining player ratings, win shares, and team success, we assess whether MVP winners dominate consistently or if competition varies yearly.

Krystal_EDA: analyze mvp winners from 2000-2024 compared to other players who meet minimum mvp scores. the players are compared in PTS, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, FG%, 3P%, FT%, WS, WS/48.

Ricardi_EDA: Determining the value gerated by each position on the court and finding which positions are most valuable based on statistic gathered and MVP voting.
